  ## Description
  This is my portfolio which has been developed using React. It contains four sections, an About page, a Portfolio page linking to some of my recent projects, a Contact page for feedback and chat and lastly a Resume page listing my skills and links to my full Resume. The portfolio page contains links to the deployed applications where applicable and also links to the associated GitHub repositories.

  The application was styled using Tailwind and uses some Google fonts. It includes some animations on the About page and the Contact page. Please submit your message to see the animations!
  
  The application is developed using the following technologies:
  - Javascript
  - React
  - Tailwind

  The main challenge in developing this application was getting the file structure correct and familiarisation with React.
